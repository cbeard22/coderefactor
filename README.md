# Horiseon Website Code Refractor

# Description
This assignment was to refactor the code for the Horiseon website by making the HTML tags more specific for future website maintance. Alt attributes were also added to images to make it more accessible in search engines and for screen readers. The websites appearance will not change but it will be easier to maintain and easier to find with search engines. 

#Usage
Upload the index.html and the assets folder to open the website. The CSS stylesheet and images are stored in the assets folder. There are three navigation links at the top of the page that will direct you to the correct section in the body of the website.
